# Michigan Fish Stocking Trends (2000-2005)

---

This project analyzes historical fish stocking data from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) between 2000 and 2025. The aim is to uncover long term patterns in the stocking practices across water bodies, identify ecological or management shifts, and explore changes in species level stocking over time.

---

## Objectives
**Trend analysis:** Determine weather total stocking numbers have increased or decreased since 2000.
**Geographic Impact:** Identify which lakes, rivers, or streams have seen:
  - A **significant increase** in stocking efforts.
  - A **notable decrease** or complete halt in stocking.
- **Species Insights:**
  - Determine the **most stocked species**.
  - Determine the **least stocked species**.
- **Temporal Breakdown:** Evaluate changes in stocking by year and season, if data allows.

## Tools Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` / `PowerBI` for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration
- **CSV File** as raw data input

---

## Data Source

- Source: [MDNR Fish Stocking Database](https://www.dnr.state.mi.us/fishstock/)
- Format: CSV
- Fields include: Year, Species, Number Stocked, Waterbody, County, Stocking Method, Size, Date

---

## Sample Questions Explored

- How has total fish stocking volume changed over time?
- Are certain regions (counties/waterbodies) seeing more or less stocking?
- Which species are prioritized in recent years?
- Are trends influenced by policy, environment, or recreation?

---

## Example Visualizations

- Line graph: Total fish stocked by year
- Bar chart: Top 10 most frequently stocked water bodies
- Heatmap: Species stocking density across years
- Pie chart: Species distribution by count

---

## To Do

- [ ] Clean and normalize the raw dataset
- [ ] Aggregate by year/species/waterbody
- [ ] Calculate change rates per location
- [ ] Create dashboards and charts
- [ ] Interpret findings and write conclusions

---

## Insights Coming Soon

Once analysis is complete, I’ll summarize key findings such as:
- Overall stocking trends
- Ecological or policy implications
- Recommendations for anglers, or decision-makers
