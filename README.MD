# Michigan Fish Stocking Trends (2000-2005)

---

This project analyzes historical fish stocking data from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) between 2000 and 2025. The aim is to uncover long term patterns in the stocking practices across water bodies, identify ecological or management shifts, and explore changes in species level stocking over time.

---

## Objectives
**Trend analysis:** Determine weather total stocking numbers have increased or decreased since 2000.
**Geographic Impact:** Identify which lakes, rivers, or streams have seen:
  - A **significant increase** in stocking efforts.
  - A **notable decrease** or complete halt in stocking.
- **Species Insights:**
  - Determine the **most stocked species**.
  - Determine the **least stocked species**.
- **Temporal Breakdown:** Evaluate changes in stocking by year and season, if data allows.

## Tools Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` / `PowerBI` for visualization
- **Marimo** for interactive data exploration
- **CSV File** as raw data input

## Data Source

- Source: [MDNR Fish Stocking Database](https://www.dnr.state.mi.us/fishstock/)
- Format: CSV
- Fields include: Year, Species, Number Stocked, Waterbody, County, Size, Date

## Sample Questions Explored

- what is the top 10 and bottom 10 fish species stocked from 2000 to 2025?
- Has salmon, trout, and steelhead stocking efforts decreased or increased since 2000?
- Which counties see the most effort in stocking? Which ones see significantly less efforts?
- What water bodies have the lowest number of stocking efforts? What water bodies have the highest stocking efforts?

## Insights Coming Soon

Once analysis is complete, I’ll summarize key findings such as:
- Overall stocking trends
- Recommendations for anglers
- Top fishing destinations based on stocking data
